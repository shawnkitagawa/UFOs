# UFOs
Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis is to have a better understanding of UFO sightings by allowing to have a filter search by multiple criteria at the same time.

Results:
People may use the filter search to find the location of where UFO have been watched. For example, when filtering Oregon, there's 3 row of data that shows that people have saw the UFO in oregon. two of them are seeing the UFO in slight different location but the same date, which tells that there are multiple people seeing the same UFO. 

Conclusion:
The design looks clean with a photo of earth in the background in the top. Since UFO is something that some people do not believe, it is important to have a design with a serious tone to emphasize that UFO is an acutal thing. If I could change, I will add multiple photo of UFO. Some people do not believe with evidence and providing some photo might attract more beleivers. Also I reccomend to add more feature such as creating a forum where people can actually write a text about UFO so that they can interact more.
